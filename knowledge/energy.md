# Energy

Someone told me that almost everybody who finds themselves running out of time actually runs out of energy. This is very true. If you had infinite energy, you would accomplish far more throughout a single day, compared to having more hours in a day, where you would be tired from the same amount of work you did before.

## Increasing Energy

Time is a finite resource, but energy is not:

> Energy can be systematically expanded and regularly renewed by establishing specific rituals—behaviors that are intentionally practiced and precisely scheduled, with the goal of making them unconscious and automatic as quickly as possible.

Eating, sleeping, and exercising well are all obvious keys to increasing the amount of energy you have, but juggling them  is a worthy challenge in and of itself.

Emotional state is also important to your energy level:

> Most people realize that they tend to perform best when they’re feeling positive energy. What they find surprising is that they’re not able to perform well or to lead effectively when they’re feeling any other way.

## Organizations

It turns out that a lot of processes in corporations take longer than a more creative approach would, but the upside is the consistency and monotony - although it takes longer, it takes less energy. This is probably one of the reasons why startups have such a huge advantage over established corporations - the lack of existing process.

## Life

In my own experience, I found that while mindless chores like washing the dishes or taking showers expends more physical energy than staying at a desk and typing at a keyboard, your mind can go pretty much on full auto mode. These kind of tasks can help you rest your mind.
