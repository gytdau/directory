# Energy

I'm not sure where I heard it from, but someone told me that almost everybody who finds themselves running out of time actually runs out of energy. This has rung true to most of my life.

Time is a finite resource, but energy is not.

> Energy can be systematically expanded and regularly renewed by establishing specific rituals—behaviors that are intentionally practiced and precisely scheduled, with the goal of making them unconscious and automatic as quickly as possible.

## Organizations

It turns out that a lot of processes in corporations take longer than a more creative approach would, but the upside is the consistency and monotony - although it takes longer, it takes less energy. This is probably one of the reasons why startups have such a huge advantage over established corporations - the lack of existing process.

## Life

In my own experience, I found that while mindless chores like washing the dishes or taking showers expends more physical energy than staying at a desk and typing at a keyboard, your mind can go pretty much on full auto mode. You can get a lot of mindless things done and, at the end, only be physically tired.
