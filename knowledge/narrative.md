# Narrative

Stories are the building block of everything we know as human beings. Our brain is hardwired to store our memories in compressed, cohesive narratives. We can take pretty much any series of events, and string them together in any narrative, and through that we find meaning and purpose.

I'm starting to find a lot of success in taking control of the storytelling of my own life, and stringing my own events together in a purposely-crafted story of challenge, overcoming, and growth. These stories are fulfilling and encouraging, almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy where the stories of success you tell yourself inspire further success.

Dreams are the stories we tell ourselves of who we might become, and so it's important that you also tell those stories well.
