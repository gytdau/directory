# Work

You should work on, first and foremost, difficult challenges.

Don't care too much about prestige:

> Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first. Jazz comes to mindâ€”though almost any established art form would do. So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself. - [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html)

## Jobs

### Self employment

You can probably capture more of the value you produce if there aren't many levels of hierachy taking a progressively larger cut. Problems are also probably more interesting when you choose to work on them yourself, without the requirement of being backed by a larger organisation.

However, this might not be the full picture. Jobs in an organisation have stability, and if the place you work at is sufficiently small I suspect you'll still be able to work on things that are fun, exciting and meaningful.
