Directory is a collection of my values, thoughts, and ideas. It's a personal notebook that I use to get a better grasp on things I think are important.

## Technology

Directory runs on React, but compiles down to Javascript and is served as static files on Github.

## Purpose

Thinking is hard. Directory aims to be a place for reflection on the past, and planning for the future. It's the dashboard and control center of my life.

Directory is publicly visible because people taking interest in what I think is not an intrusion, but a great generosity. Not to mention that being public gives Directory more weight: unexpectedly, I'm still contributing to it today.

## Style guide

- Try not to hedge statements with "I think" or derivatives. It's implied that everything here is of your own opinion and viewpoint.
- Keep it concise and think big picture. This means discarding parts that are unnecessary details.
