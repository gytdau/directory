Dyslex-E is a Chrome extension that adds a reader view to articles, which is built specifically for people with dyslexia.

## Technology

Dyslexi runs on React, but it has to be compiled down to Javascript and executed as a Chrome extension.

## Purpose

The project was done voluntarily and pro-bono.

Primarily, if people are helped by this extension, that would be a net gain to the world.  Also, I believe in the leadership behind the project, and seeing the project naturally gain momentum would be very satisfying and a great learning experience.

## Status

Started on 1st December 2018.

Predicted end on February 2019.
