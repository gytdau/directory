A lot of our lives revolves around optimisation. We want to optimise how many hours we work, or even how deeply we love one another.

I approached clothes from the same front. We wear clothes every day, and so clearly refining the clothes I wear would have a large impact. On what? I do not quite know.

What, indeed, do clothes impact? Well, they have a large role in first impressions. They probably play a part in perceived confidence or perceived social value. And that should be argument enough to declare clothes as important.

But I think that is only an infinitesmal part of the story. First and foremost, our clothes are an extension of who we are. In _The Order of Time_, Carlo Rovelli comments that the way we perceive ourselves is through the mirror of how we believe others perceive us. We became so good at intuiting what other people are thinking, it became necessary to start seeing ourselves from their eyes, to guess what they felt about us, to guess how our tone of voice affects them, and to guess how our clothes made them feel. Our self image is a tapestry of different opinions and perspectives about who we are patched together.

Imagine you were a new type of person who moved in to your local area from somewhere far away. To get to grips with this foregin land, you decide to take advice only if it is fully proven and studied. And so you would optimise your actions to give you the most reward with the smallest effort you can, so that your life is maximally good.

This could seem like the ideal human being you should be. Rational, straightfoward, and it would cut out all of the superstitions and unfounded beliefs that we all carry deep in our self identity.
