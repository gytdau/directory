> Summary: I'm choosing to work on soft skills the most.

I'm not sure what I'll do in the long-term, but I know that I'll spend a large amount of my time working on something.

## Working at a company

Getting a regular job would have the potential to be fulfilling, stable, and fun, if I pick the right company to work in.

> How do you get hired at a company? Is there anything I can do to prepare myself early?

### Smaller organisations

If I work in a smaller organisation, like a startup, or a collective, or a service-based startup, I'd be responsible for more and grow faster.

> What is the difference between startup hiring process and the process of bigger companies?

### Freelancing

Working solo outside of a company is not likely to be fulfilling due to the lack of social and emotional connection with other people.

If I do decide to freelance, it'd probably be because the opportunities are higher than I'm currently imagining, and that I can form a team around it.

## Areas of growth for careers

No matter where I end up working, or who I end up working with, it'll still be all work. All of this work comes with a common skillset.

They're usually called soft skills, but this name undermines their importance, especially when communication, critical thinking, and leadership fall under the [definition of a soft skill](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/list-of-soft-skills-2063770).

These skills are important - more important than hard skills like programming. This is because of the two categories have vastly different costs assosciated with learning them.

With hard skills, you could pick up a book and eventually move on to cheap practice that can be done entirely on your laptop. On the other hand, soft skills involve real-world experience, time, and wisdom; which involves an expensive sort of practicing where you are forged into a different person. This is hard to do, and takes quite a bit of time.

It's clear that our computers are nothing more than a layer of abstraction upon our values. Every device and program is built wholly by people, for people, and through people's thoughts, beliefs, and values.

Therefore, it makes sense to learn about people first, and computers second. 

## Areas of growth for life

It's no coincidence that the soft skills companies require also make a large impact on your own life.

A job pays for your time in some sense - but most importantly, they're paying for your prescence to be in a room with other people and make progress on issues and tasks that the company cares about. The skills you need to make progress in careers translate to many of the same skills you need to make progress in life.

## Achieving growth

Soft skills are not easy to teach.

You don't go about learning hard skills, since _hard skills_ is vague and includes the skills used in every field of human endeavour. Similarly, the term 'soft skills' encompasses a range of talents that would take many human lifetimes to fully develop. 

It appears that soft skills are learned through consistent long-term exposure to working environments and good people.

The list of soft skills is so large that it's not useful to list them. They range in topics from communication, critical thinking, leadership, and work ethic, including others. I probably don't have a good view of which skills are the most valuable ones.
