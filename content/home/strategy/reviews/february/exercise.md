I've been progressing pretty linearly since my last review, but I'm starting to push myself to the brink of failing these lifts.

## Compliance

Over a period of 37 days, I managed 11 days of exercise.

This results in about 70% of potential sessions attended. I thought this figure would go down as I had a relaxed attitude towards going to the gym, but I'm pleasantly surprised that it even went slightly up.

## Results

It's hard to prioritize going to the gym above all else, but even with a relaxed approach I can get 70% of the way there.

I think I'll need a break, restart the routine, or go light for a week in order to avoid failing pretty much all my lifts at the same time.
