Mu, a Korean and Japanese term, is a word we do not have an adequate parallel for in the English language.

It means "no thing". For example, imagine a computer to have either ones or zeroes. You turn the computer off and ask does it contain a one or zero. The answer to the question is Mu.

Mu is an answer which suggests that the question does not make sense to ask when considering reality. We are conditioned to think that every question has an answer, while offering Mu as a response signifies defeat. This is incorrect. It's vital to understand that not every question should be asked, and inherent in the question may be significant flaws.

The closest parallel to Mu in English is _n/a_.

Mu is used to indicate a question whose "answer" is to:

- un-ask the question,
- indicate the question is fundamentally flawed, or
- reject the premise that a [dualistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-dual) answer can or will be given.
