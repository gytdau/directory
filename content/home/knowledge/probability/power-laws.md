A power law is a relationship between two things, where the first thing is just the second thing raised to a power.

## Mathematics

When we talk about power laws, we're really just talking about raising a variable to the _n_-th power, and the kind of distributions that emerge. A power law looks like _y = m * x^b_, where y and x are our variables, m is a constant (you can leave it at 1), and b is the power we're raising x to.

The Pareto Principle, which states that for many events, 80% of the events come from 20% of the causes, is an example of a power law. 

## Application

Many things we believe follow a linear relationship actually follow an exponential relationship.
