You should work on, first and foremost, difficult challenges.

Don't care too much about prestige:

> Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first. Jazz comes to mindâ€”though almost any established art form would do. So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself. - [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html)
