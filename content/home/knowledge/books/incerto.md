Incerto is a series of books about uncertainty and human error written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

I've read, but probably not fully understood:

- [Fooled by Randomness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness)
- [The Black Swan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable)

The books are eye-opening, but the nature of the topic makes them sometimes hard to process.
