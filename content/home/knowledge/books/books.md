A list of the books I've read and would like to re-read.

## Reading

Reading is still the most viable way to take in new information from diverse sources. It can be easily paused, rewinded, and played at whatever pace you'd like. It doesn't produce sound, expire, or become unavailable.

I want to read more. I should start with fiction, but sometimes I lose track of character names. I might want to start noting down minor details so that I'm less likely to become lost and disinterested.
