In terms of what I believe the most likely to be true, I am a:

- [Hard determinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism), meaning that free will is impossible and your choices are a result of some conbination of your nature and nurture
- [Eliminative materialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliminative_materialism), meaning that, in particular, consciousness does not exist, and the term will be eventually eliminated as neuroscience progresses
- [Absurdist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism), meaning that you must awknowledge that there is no meaning or purpose to our lives and universe, but despite this, our biology demands we pursue it and believe in it
