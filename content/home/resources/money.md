I suspect most people have no idea what to do with money. I'm not sure what to do with it, either, except spend it the best way you know how: through large, future-oriented investments.

I imagine you don't need a lot of money to be happy, but depending on the type of environment you're in, you could need a lot of money to shape it into something that's a pleasure to live in. This could mean removing stressors, relocating, eating well, and having spare time.
