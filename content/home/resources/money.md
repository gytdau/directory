I suspect most people have no idea what to do with money.

We are, at heart, optimizing for emotional happiness. This can come in many ways, like fulfillment, meaning, and pride. Purchases like TVs or bigger homes are just a really inefficient way to try to reach those goals.

We are persuaded into these kinds of purchases by advertising, our social structure, and our government. Consumerism is great for economies, but not so much for people.

Some difficult problems can be solved through money, but everything else is  an entirely different type of engineering challenge.
