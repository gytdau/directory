People consistently underestimate how much less competent they are when they are unhappy.

Sam mentions a pattern which applies to me, but I was unaware was so general:

> Like most people, I sometimes go through periods of a week or two where I just have no motivation to do anything (I suspect it may have something to do with nutrition).  This sucks and always seems to happen at inconvenient times.  I have not figured out what to do about it besides wait for the fog to lift, and to trust that eventually it always does.  And I generally try to avoid people and situations that put me in bad moods, which is good advice whether you care about productivity or not. - [Productivity, Sam Altman](http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity)
