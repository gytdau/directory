I try to replace as much of my diet as is convenient with Huel, which is a powdered food replacement.

| Nutritional attributes |              |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| Flavour                | Huel Vanilla |
| Calories per gram      | 4kcal        |
| Personal serving size  | 190g         |
| Calories per serving   | 760kcal      |
| Calorie daily target   | 3000kcal     |
| Huel meals per day     | 4            |

Powdered food offers a significant benefit on time savings and nutritional content. Huel usually accomodates for 50% of my calorie intake.

## Other food

> Eating lots of sugar is the thing that makes me feel the worst and that I try hardest to avoid.  I also try to avoid foods that aggravate my digestion or spike up inflammation (for example, very spicy foods).  I donâ€™t have much willpower when it comes to sweet things, so I mostly just try to keep junk food out of the house. - [Productivity, Sam Altman](http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity)
