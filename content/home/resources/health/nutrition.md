I try to replace as much of my diet as is convenient with Huel, which is a powdered food replacement.

| Nutritional attributes |              |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| Flavour                | Huel Vanilla |
| Calories per gram      | 4kcal        |
| Personal serving size  | 190g         |
| Calories per serving   | 760kcal      |
| Calorie daily target   | 3000kcal     |
| Huel meals per day     | 4            |

Powdered food offers a significant benefit on time savings and nutritional content. Huel usually accomodates for 50% of my calorie intake.

### Against Sugar

> Eating lots of sugar is the thing that makes me feel the worst and that I try hardest to avoid.  I also try to avoid foods that aggravate my digestion or spike up inflammation (for example, very spicy foods).  I donâ€™t have much willpower when it comes to sweet things, so I mostly just try to keep junk food out of the house. - [Productivity, Sam Altman](http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity)

Sugary food does not work for me on any scale. Some people suggest cutting down on the sugary food you eat. I don't think this works well.

I don't really enjoy sugary food, but if I have it around, I'll instintinctively grab more on autopilot. I almost always feel worse after I eat any volume of it. I think I should figure out how to get rid of it entirely, and replace it with snacks that are less intensely sugary.

Sugary food is extremely widely available. If I were to cut it down by a meaningfully large percentage, the most likely solution would be to tackle my habits in getting food - shop at different places, or preprepare food, or pick snacks that aren't as sugary.

### Eating for Pleasure

By cutting down on the amount of meals I'm forced to make, I can enjoy the meals I choose to make.

I've started eating more fruit, and significantly cut down on the meat I eat on average.
