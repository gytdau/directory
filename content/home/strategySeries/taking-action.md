While we normally take action in order to make our lives better, it could be more useful to take action based on _salience_.

Salience is the quality of standing out - in plain terms, it means interesting. Prioritising on salience is far more likely to allow you to learn quickly and avoid unproductive dead-ends (local maximums).

Leading a more interesting life would yield more long-term gains.
