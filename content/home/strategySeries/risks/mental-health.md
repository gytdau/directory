## Loneliness

Short periods of loneliness is fine, but when sustained, subjective feelings of loneliness can pose serious risks to emotional well-being, quality of life and length and level of physiological health.

The feeling of being lonely is a subjective experience, and so can occur even when you're surrounded by friends.

### Mitigation

Take more time to form meaningful relationships, reach out to people, and take part in social events. Long-term exposure to loneliness can probably be prevented through habitually ingrained patterns of reaching out and resolving feelings of isolation as soon as they occur.

## Depression

Significant life events, abuse, and conflict are risk factors for depression. LGBT people are disproportionately and highly affected by mental health issues due to minority stress.

### Mitigation
According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/depression/understanding-depression-prevention#1), prevention includes:
- Find ways to handle stress and improve your self-esteem.
- Take good care of yourself. Get enough sleep, eat well, and exercise regularly.
- Reach out to family and friends when times get hard.
- Get help if you think youâ€™re depressed. If you wait, it could get worse.
