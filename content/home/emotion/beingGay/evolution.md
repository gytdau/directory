Hypotheses for the impact of the post-natal social environment on sexual orientation are weak, especially for males. [(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation#cite_note-Bailey-4) This means that sexual orientation is mostly determined by genetics.

The most convincing reason for a gay gene to be favoured by evolution is called the gay uncle hypothesis. It is believed that gay people, although not being able to reproduce directly, conferred a large advantage to family units, as they did not need to produce children when resources were scarce.
