In popular culture, there is a concept of a 'gaydar' - the ability to detect the stereotype of queer people.

In studies, this intuitive sense perfomed higher than chance when the subjects were shown people who were conforming to the stereotypes. People who broke stereotypes yielded less accurate assesment by the subjects.

Many gay people do not conform to the gay stereotype.

## Speech

Voices that are higher and more melodious are more often labelled gay. This voice, which is more stereotypically feminine, is most likely imprinted from females that the person was influenced by, like parents and friends.

People can code-switch, which is subconciously slipping into another accent when they are with a different group of people.
