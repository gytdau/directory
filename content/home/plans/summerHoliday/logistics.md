## Restrictions

I can access Europe with my passport. For other countries outside of Europe, I'd need a visa. Flying to other countries is probably financially unsustainable.

## Travel to mainland

I don't know how to get from Ireland to mainland Europe. This could involve a ferry to either mainland, or to the UK, and then rail from there.

## Interrail Tickets

Interrail tickets for two months would be 562 euro. This is about 9.20 a day and 64 a week.

It is questionable that I'd spend 64 a week on rail-based transport. Also, more importantly, I want to reserve the freedom to choose other modes of transport.
