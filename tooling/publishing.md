# Publishing

These are the three sites which are hosted somewhere on Github. It's simpler and cheaper to let Github host things.

## Blog

[My blog](http://blog.gytis.co) is a simple stripped down Jekyll site.

I use it to write long-form thoughts and explorations of concepts, or to try to cement ideas into my mind.

## Directory

[This directory](http://directory.gytis.co) runs off of [Docsify.js.](https://docsify.js.org) To generate the index on the left, I created `reindex.js`, which you run whenever you've made a change in the directory structure. In the future, this might want to adopt a watch pattern, where it reindexes automatically.

This is supposed to be a long-term catalog of ideas, values, and knowledge. The Blog and the Directory kind of overlap.

## Portfolio

[My portfolio](http://gytis.co) is a few simple HTML files. It's currently hosted on my domain, gytis.co, but I don't know if I should relax on the portfolio stuff until I start looking for a job.
