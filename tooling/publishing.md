# Publishing

These are the three sites which are hosted somewhere on Github. It's simpler and cheaper to let Github host things.

## Blog

[My blog](http://blog.gytdau.com) is a simple stripped down Jekyll site, hosted on Github pages.

## Directory

This directory runs off of [Docsify.js.](https://docsify.js.org) To generate the index on the left, I created `reindex.js`, which you run whenever you've made a change in the directory structure. In the future, this might want to adopt a watch pattern, where it reindexes automatically.

If this project succeeds functionally, I'll adjust the theme to match.

## Portfolio

[My portfolio](http://gytdau.com) is a few simple HTML files. I think I should take greater pride in my web presence so I should redesign it eventually to be a better indicator of who I am.
