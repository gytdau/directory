# Writing

Taking down notes is a difficult problem to fully capture. I don't need to archive much of what I take down so my systems are very ephemeral and temporary, adapting to whatever is more convinient at the time. These frameworks are usually how I work.

## Digital

I write using Typora, and save files to my disk. I don't back up my documents because my writing is scattered all over my directories, and creating a backup process would be a large investment. Theoretically, anything important should already be published. I should get around to getting one eventually.

### Journal

I keep an encrypted archive of journal entries. Encrypting makes it feel like a physcologically safer space. I don't back up these journals either.

I don't usually read back on these journal entries. I'm not sure if you're supposed to.

I haven't written a journal entry in a long time, particularly because right now it's replaced by writing in this directory.

## Physical

My current strategy is getting a high-quality notebook where you can tear away pages, and keeping each thought seperated on one page. Tear away a page to start a new thought. These pages form a stack which represents tasks and thoughts in progress.

This is very good for capturing everything you can think of, since you just get a blank page and start writing. It doesn't take into account prioritization or time sensitivity, so things might get lost for a while until you sort through your pages again. I might expand this system to get folders.

You could keep boxes of old pages, but I just throw them away for now.

# Capturing thoughts

I've always been fascinated with how many good ideas you have that might just be lost forever. From what I can tell right now, this might be a very small quantity.
