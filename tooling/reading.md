# Reading

I end up listening to a lot of audiobooks on my long commute. I'm planning to take down book notes in Directory, and have Todoist tasks for each book, reminding me to revise the books again after a few weeks or months. The goal is to better assimilate information so that I can learn more effectively.

The hope is that each document could begin to reference each other, linking knowledge and concepts between books in my own personal network of facts and information.
