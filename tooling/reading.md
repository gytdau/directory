# Reading

I end up listening to a lot of audiobooks on my long commute. I have to-do tasks that remind me to revise over books that I find interesting in order to better understand the knowledge I've gained.

Writing summaries makes the entire process way less fun, since it stops you from getting sucked into the book's story. I instead try to query myself every-so-often on what I just learned, and write down notes on things I do not understand.
