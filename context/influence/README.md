# Influence

I'm pretty young right now, and I think I'm pretty easily influenced by the people around me, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Nassim Taleb, in [The Black Swan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable), made a great point that, in professions dominated by unpredictable but large gains, people should form communities isolated from the judgement of the outside world. Other people, his argument follows, judge those that produce no tangible results very harshly, branding them as failiures, when in reality it might just take a very long time — an unpredictably long time — for work to succeed.

Similar emphasis can be placed on the content you read and watch, since exposure to people and ideas can be a large driving force behind your personal change. Being surrounded by ideas of a certain group will nudge you closer to the group's average. It's pretty important to ensure you choose your friends wisely, since you'll slowly drift towards the average of their ideas.
