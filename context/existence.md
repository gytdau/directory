# Existence

I don't like to think about existence since existential angst is really painful to experience.

Sam Altman provided a [sobering stance on this:](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short)

> Existential angst is part of life.  It is particularly noticeable around major life events or just after major career milestones.  It seems to particularly affect smart, ambitious people.  I think one of the reasons some people work so hard is so they don’t have to spend too much time thinking about this.

As per instructions given, I usually like to work hard to deter the existential angst from creeping in. This works pretty well, so I'd recommend it if you're feeling the same way. If that doesn't work, try going outside and running as fast as you can, until you almost collapse from exhaustion. You usually stop thinking about it pretty quickly.

## Meaning

I matured from nihilism into absurdism. Don't take the poor naming at face value.

Daniel Miesller wrote excellent reasoning for absurdism in [Meaning is an Illusion:](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/meaning-is-an-illusion/)

> Neither meaning nor free will can be solved satisfactorily to humans because the true answers are not compatible with human experience.
> We cannot live our daily lives as if there is no meaning in the universe. We cannot generate our own and pretend it’s intrinsic. So all we can do is choose a path that is in accordance with our moral framework, that grants some measure of fulfillment, and move forward.

For a quick summary, the only practical step involved in aburdism is to not think about it.
