## Meaning

Daniel Miesller wrote excellent reasoning for absurdism in [Meaning is an Illusion:](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/meaning-is-an-illusion/)

> Neither meaning nor free will can be solved satisfactorily to humans because the true answers are not compatible with human experience.
> We cannot live our daily lives as if there is no meaning in the universe. We cannot generate our own and pretend itâ€™s intrinsic. So all we can do is choose a path that is in accordance with our moral framework, that grants some measure of fulfillment, and move forward.
