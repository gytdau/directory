# Experience

The state of our experience does not match the state of reality, and there is no way to reconcile the difference. The only way forward is to come to terms with it and do the best you can.

## Responsibility

We did not choose any part of our lives. The only two factors that influenced us - nature, such as our genetics, and nurture, such as our parenting - lie far outside of our control. You aren't responsible for your situation and you aren't responsible for what you do.

## Consciousness

> The best way to describe self consciousness is as a representational process: an image that is sometimes generated in the brain. Sometimes it’s not generated, for example in dreamless, deep sleep. It’s a very fragile and vulnerable, intermittent phenomenon, but there is no metaphysical entity such as the self which could exist independently of the brain. - [Thomas Metzinger](https://deconstructingyourself.com/what-is-the-self-metzinger.html) in an interview with Deconstructing Yourself

Consciousness is an illusion that your mind plays on itself. Consciousness and your sense of self blinks in and out of existence. In that sense, you (the part that thinks and feels) is far less of a constant experience than a bumpy ride that phases in and out quickly.

> the self evolved as a biologically useful construct to “match sensory perceptions onto motor behavior in a meaningful way.” - [Thomas Metzinger](http://nautil.us/issue/47/consciousness/you-cant-upload-your-self-into-virtual-reality) in an interview with Nautilus
