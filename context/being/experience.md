# Experience

The more I learn about our experience, the more illusions I see there are. They all have something in common: the state of our experience does not match the state of reality, and there is no way to reconcile the difference. This is very much a situation where you come to terms with it, and move forwards, doing the best you can.

## Responsibility

We did not choose any part of our lives. The only two factors that influenced us - nature, such as our genetics, and nurture, such as our parenting - lie far outside of our control. This does not mean you are responsible for it any more than you are responsible for a scientist rolling a pair of die that decides your fate - in other words, not at all.

Since we are beings that react to stimulus using the biological hardware we're given, it's a completely counterintuitive but logically sound idea that we do not have free will in any amount, nor can we cannot take any responsibility for our actions. Even if you do terribly well or terribly poorly, your grit, perserverance and dedication (or lack thereof) was not of your choosing. You are completely and entirely a product of the genetics you inherited and the culture you were born into.

## Consciousness

> The best way to describe self consciousness is as a representational process: an image that is sometimes generated in the brain. Sometimes it’s not generated, for example in dreamless, deep sleep. It’s a very fragile and vulnerable, intermittent phenomenon, but there is no metaphysical entity such as the self which could exist independently of the brain. - [Thomas Metzinger](https://deconstructingyourself.com/what-is-the-self-metzinger.html) in an interview with Deconstructing Yourself

Consciousness is an illusion that your mind plays on itself. To make matters even more disconcerting, consciousness and your sense of self blinks in and out of existence - such as when you go to sleep, when you meditate, when you are very focused on your work, or even when you're just lost in thought. In that sense, you (the thinking, feeling you) are far less of a constant experience than a bumpy ride that phases in and out quickly.

> the self evolved as a biologically useful construct to “match sensory perceptions onto motor behavior in a meaningful way.” - [Thomas Metzinger](http://nautil.us/issue/47/consciousness/you-cant-upload-your-self-into-virtual-reality) in an interview with Nautilus
