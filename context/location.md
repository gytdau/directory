# Location

I've lived in Dublin ever since my parents moved here. I keep finding new things to do and explore even now.

## Moving

It's not very likely that the place I was born in, or rather was moved to at a young age, is a perfect fit. Travelling around and finally moving somewhere else sounds like a more logical plan, since I have suspicions that I would be far happier in other places.

I've always liked the idea of moving. I'm thinking of moving to Switzerland, where the standard of life is higher and developers are paid more. If I do move, I think the next ten years would be the prime time to do so. I might have to learn a new language, which I'm not against doing.

One strategy for moving incrementally is to temporarily move somewhere for a summer, which I can do while I'm in college. That would require I get a short-term job or an internship to support me.

### Nomadic approach

Being a digital nomad means having no fixed home point, and travelling around the world to work remotely. A more casual definition would just be travelling frequently, even if that could mean every few months or years.

I imagine being a digital nomad would be fun and eye-opening at parts, but adopting a full nomadic approach very probably isn't sustainable for any meaningful amount of time. Loneliness and fatigue would set in pretty quickly, and it would be difficult to form valuable relationships.

A more relaxed approach might work better, instead travelling for a couple of months, and returning home for most of the year.

## Candidates for moving

California is probably out due to the strict immigration policies of the United States, as well as the high living expenses.

Since I don't have any subjective experiences to base decisions on, national metrics are my best bet. The Quality of Life index is preferred over the Standard of Living index, since the former is tied to a person's ability to acquire more and better goods.

```
Top software developer wages
1. USA
2. Switzerland
3. Norway
4. Israel
5. Denmark
```

The Quality of Life index, as calculated by [seemingly arbitrary definitions](https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/indices_explained.jsp):

```
Quality of Life index
1. Denmark
2. Finland
3. Switzerland
4. Australia
5. Austria
```

Ireland places disappointingly low on both lists. On a cursory examination, Switzerland and Finland seem like good candidates. You could get more technical and more correct by adjusting software developer wages relative to living expenses, and also by understanding the statistics themselves, but the lines are always blurry and the answers are always only roughly correct, so I won't bother with precision.
