<p>It's probable that meditation can serve as the basis of a secular but spiritual practice. My thinking is that I can develop a ritual of meditation to increase the feeling of connection, peace, and to take time to reflect.</p>

<p>Secular spirituality emphasizes the personal growth and inner peace of the individual, rather than a relationship with the divine. Secular spirituality is made up of the search for meaning outside of a religious institution; it considers one's relationship with the self, others, nature, and whatever else one considers to be the ultimate. Often, the goal of secular spirituality is living happily and/or helping others. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_spirituality">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Meditation provides modest relief for anxiety and pain.</p>
<p>If you're not suffering from any illness or repressed trauma, meditation isn't likely to cause harm.</p>
