Instead of being so absorbed, we should instead aim to step back and allow them to pass.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You are not your thoughts.</li>\n<li>It&#39;s very useful to stand back from your thoughts and just observe them happening.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"sensations\">Sensations</h2>\n<p>If you&#39;re sitting down and think of the pressure between you and your chair, you think of a solid shape of equal pressure. But if you dig deeper, the shape is far less solid and the boundaries are not as sharp.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sensations are fundamentally netural. They are only information going into your brain.</li>\n<li>Your mind is engaged with amplyfing weak sensations, but you can see through this amplification when applying minimal effort.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"emotion\">Emotion</h2>\n<p>You can descibe emotion as the way you see the colour of a room. Smallest emotions can spiral into something more difficult to manage.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you look at your emotional states, they dissapear.</li>\n<li>This can give you some relief when times are hard.</li>\n</ol>\n","folder":0},"children_notes":[]}}
