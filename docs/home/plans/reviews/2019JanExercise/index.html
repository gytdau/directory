<p>I haven’t failed at any Tier 1 exercises except the Overhead Press, which was probably contributed to by a lack of micro plates at my gym. (Do gyms seriously have 0.625kg plates?)</p>
<h2 id="compliance">Compliance</h2>
<p>Over a period of 57 days, I finished four sets of these four exercises, meaning 16 days of exercise.</p>
<p>8 weeks of time passed, and I did an equivalent of 5 weeks of exercise, resulting in 66% of potential sessions attended. I missed 1 week because of Christmas.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>66% of potential sessions attended isn’t too bad, considering it’s bumped up to 75% when excluding Christmas. I should bump it up to 80%, which still allows for off days when something important comes up. </p>
<p>I seem to be keeping up with the plan, which is a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>I might want to look into changing my gym, to somewhere without a pool, or that many machines.</p>
