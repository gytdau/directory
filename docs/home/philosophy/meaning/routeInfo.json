An event is less meaningful if it&#39;s a dead end - it didn&#39;t cause many events afterwards.</p>\n<p>This is an interesting perspective to view meaning through. If we want our lives to be more meaningful, it could mean that we need to become a part of the chain of events and start more things that would not have been started otherwise.</p>\n","folder":0},"children_notes":[]}}
