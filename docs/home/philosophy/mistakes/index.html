<p>Due to the structure of our social networks, mistakes have a more negative sentiment than was previously possible. This is for two reasons.</p>
<p>For one, we consistently only see people's successes. In our social networks, people only want to share their successes in order to cast themselves in a better light. People's failiures are rarely shown as they are embarrased and make themselves appear less strong. This causes a negative loop where as people share less mistakes, people feel more implicitly bad about their mistakes, and less people share them.</p>
<p>Another reason is that in our news culture, we see people grilled for mistakes all the time. Anger is one of the easiest emotions to spread, and so anger at our political representatives, our managers, employers, and people in general has reached a new high. If we are ever exposed to mistakes, we only see them in the worst possible light. If we didn't, the news wouldn't sell.</p>

<p>It's cliche to say that a mistake was a learning experience. But like all cliches, it's true, and the wisdom within this particular cliche proves to be very valuable.</p>
<p>Consider this statement from a different perspective.</p>
<p>Imagine a simple number game where you have to guess numbers within some bounds that you don't know.

And indeed, one wrong guess could tell you far more than ten right guesses.  </p>
