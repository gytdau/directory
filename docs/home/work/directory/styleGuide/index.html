<p>Keeping a record of what you're thinking comes with an overhead. It's important that the overhead is justified, and whatever you're writing is important.</p>
<p>To write on a subject, it'll need to pass these checks.</p>
<ol>
<li>You're interested in the subject.</li>
<li>You think there's something you haven't yet learned about it.</li>
<li>You believe that, if learned, the knowledge will be valuable to you and help shape your life into something better.</li>

<p>Try not to hedge statements with "I think" or derivatives. It's implied that everything here is of your own opinion and viewpoint.</p>
<p>Only include the important part.</p>
<h2 id="editing">Editing</h2>
<p>Editing is the most important part of this entire process. It's where you test your beliefs, research, rearrange and form a new narrative.</p>
<p>A lot of bad ideas should be thrown away at this stage, providing massive value by making sure you aren't misled by them. Less is almost always more.</p>
