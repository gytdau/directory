<p>Don&#39;t care too much about prestige:</p>

<p>Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you&#39;ll make it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first. Jazz comes to mind—though almost any established art form would do. So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself. - <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">Paul Graham</a></p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-work-">How do you work?</h2>
<p>In my experience, work is easiest and most productive when you&#39;re interested in a problem. This makes todo lists hard to follow, since you&#39;ll see a list of complicated tasks rather than interesting problems to solve. One way you could combat that is by reading a task and thinking about the vision behind it - consider the intricacies, purpose, and meaning.</p>

Our planning on the architecture side of Tutorello helped building the application, but it might have been better if we had planned even more.</p>\n<p>The timing on the project was difficult to coordinate. Oisin and I had different schedules, and we took on responsibility for different ends of the project - Oisin was on the backend, and I was on the front end. This sounded like a reasonable split but it ended up that we couldn&#39;t fully build features on our own, having to always wait for the other side to ask for clarification and then build the correct functionality. Next time, we probably shouldn&#39;t do this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"status\">Status</h2>\n<p>Started on 30th July 2018.</p>\n<p>Predicted end on February 2019. </p>\n","folder":0}]},"siteData":{"title":"React Static"}};</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/bootstrap.1d999e67.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/src/containers/Note.0d36c2f5.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/main.9c4a8b43.js"></script></body></html>
