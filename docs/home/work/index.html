Our planning on the architecture side of Tutorello helped building the application, but it might have been better if we had planned even more.</p>\n<p>The timing on the project was difficult to coordinate. Oisin and I had different schedules, and we took on responsibility for different ends of the project - Oisin was on the backend, and I was on the front end. This sounded like a reasonable split but it ended up that we couldn&#39;t fully build features on our own, having to always wait for the other side to ask for clarification and then build the correct functionality. Next time, we probably shouldn&#39;t do this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"status\">Status</h2>\n<p>Started on 30th July 2018.</p>\n<p>Predicted end on February 2019. </p>\n","folder":0},{"path":"home/work/directory","name":"Directory","parent":"home/work","contents":"<p>Directory is a collection of my values, thoughts, and ideas.
