Is there anything I can do to prepare myself early?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"smaller-organisations\">Smaller organisations</h3>\n<p>If I work in a smaller organisation, like a startup, or a collective, or a service-based startup, I&#39;d be responsible for more and grow faster.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the difference between startup hiring process and the process of bigger companies?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"freelancing\">Freelancing</h3>\n<p>Working solo outside of a company is not likely to be fulfilling due to the lack of social and emotional connection with other people.</p>\n<p>If I do decide to freelance, it&#39;d probably be because the opportunities are higher than I&#39;m currently imagining, and that I can form a team around it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"areas-of-growth-for-careers\">Areas of growth for careers</h2>\n<p>No matter where I end up working, or who I end up working with, it&#39;ll still be all work. All of this work comes with a common skillset.</p>\n<p>They&#39;re usually called soft skills, but this name undermines their importance, especially when communication, critical thinking, and leadership fall under the <a href=\"https://www.thebalancecareers.com/list-of-soft-skills-2063770\">definition of a soft skill</a>.</p>\n<p>These skills are important - more important than hard skills like programming. This is because of the two categories have vastly different costs assosciated with learning them.</p>\n<p>With hard skills, you could pick up a book and eventually move on to cheap practice that can be done entirely on your laptop. On the other hand, soft skills involve real-world experience, time, and wisdom; which involves an expensive sort of practicing where you are forged into a different person. This is hard to do, and takes quite a bit of time.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s clear that our computers are nothing more than a layer of abstraction upon our values. Every device and program is built wholly by people, for people, and through people&#39;s thoughts, beliefs, and values.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it makes sense to learn about people first, and computers second. </p>\n<h2 id=\"areas-of-growth-for-life\">Areas of growth for life</h2>\n<p>It&#39;s no coincidence that the soft skills companies require also make a large impact on your own life.</p>\n<p>A job pays for your time in some sense - but most importantly, they&#39;re paying for your prescence to be in a room with other people and make progress on issues and tasks that the company cares about. The skills you need to make progress in careers translate to many of the same skills you need to make progress in life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"achieving-growth\">Achieving growth</h2>\n<p>Soft skills are not easy to teach.</p>\n<p>You don&#39;t go about learning hard skills, since <em>hard skills</em> is vague and includes the skills used in every field of human endeavour. Similarly, the term &#39;soft skills&#39; encompasses a range of talents that would take many human lifetimes to fully develop. </p>\n<p>This is the area in which the soft skills and hard skills distinction needs to discarded for something more nuanced.</p>\n","folder":0},"children_notes":[]}}
