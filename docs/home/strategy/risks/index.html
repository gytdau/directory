<p>While we are on high alert for a quick loss, we can't grasp or seem to care about losses that may accumulate over long-term periods of time. Each individual loss is invisible, and so we aren't aware of it chipping away at our life until we look back at the end of it and realize we have suffered greatly.</p>
<p>A balanced approach to risk would therefore need to consider long-term risks, which can often be far more dangerous.</p>
