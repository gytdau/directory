A lot of time was spent socializing, having fun, and I&#39;ve recently started to cook and clean more. It&#39;s great and all, but I think I need to be more proactively productive in order to increase the quality of life in my future.</p>\n<p>A distinct vision on what I should be doing is what I&#39;m missing. However, it&#39;s hard to formulate one in the face of almost limitless possibility. If limitations breed creativity, a lack of them bludgeons creativity to death.
