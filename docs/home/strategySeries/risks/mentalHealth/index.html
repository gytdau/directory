<p>Short periods of loneliness is fine, but when sustained, subjective feelings of loneliness can pose serious risks to emotional well-being, quality of life and length and level of physiological health.</p>
<p>The feeling of being lonely is a subjective experience, and so can occur even when you're surrounded by friends.</p>

<p>Take more time to form meaningful relationships, reach out to people, and take part in social events. Long-term exposure to loneliness can probably be prevented through habitually ingrained patterns of reaching out and resolving feelings of isolation as soon as they occur.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.webmd.com/depression/understanding-depression-prevention#1">WebMD</a>, prevention includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find ways to handle stress and improve your self-esteem.</li>
<li>Take good care of yourself. Get enough sleep, eat well, and exercise regularly.</li>
<li>Reach out to family and friends when times get hard.</li>
<li>Get help if you think you’re depressed. If you wait, it could get worse.</li>
</ul>
