<p>In November 2018, I changed from <em>5/3/1</em> to <em>GZCLP</em>. Four months later, in March 2019, I decided to switch back to <em>5/3/1</em>, with an assistance template called <em>Boring But Big</em>.</p>
<p>I've reviewed my progress in training through the past 8 months below.</p>

<h4 id="comparison">Comparison</h4>
<p>Over eight months of tracked data, the <a href="https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards">strength standards</a> say that I rank about the same for all my lifts, given my increased bodyweight. I've gained somewhere around 5-7kg of weight, probably mostly muscle.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p> "Work, sleep, family, fitness, or friends--pick three. It's true. In order to kick ass and do big things, I think you have to be imbalanced. I'm sure there are exceptions, but every person I've seen riding on a rocket ship was imbalanced while that rocket ship was being built. You have to decide if you want it,"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In April 2018, I casually brang up the idea of going to the gym as a fun way to work off the stress from studying. And although my friends dropped out, I stayed, coming in as often as I practically could. Now here I am, one year having passed from the day I wandered in to the weights floor and tried to get my bearings.</p>
<p>It's sobering to see that, after all this time, my progress has been consistently fluctuating around less than average.</p>
<p>The good news is that 'less than average' is still progress, and positive progress beats the true average of zero change. I'm more fit, and now I can lift more. This is pretty good.</p>
<p>Strength is a curve, where beginners make rapid gains and then they start to get dragged down after a few years as the weight gain shrinks and biological limits are approached. After two to five years of regular training, you'll reach the a steep plateau where you'll have reached your maximum potential.</p>
<p>Imagine I dedicated myself to training. After two years, I'll be 20. What am I going to do? Stop training and enjoy my strength for sixty more odd years? It's laughable to imagine that after all this time the destination would be to leave the gym and just start doing something else.</p>
<p>The curve is unyielding, and it's kind towards beginners. Whether it takes two, four, or six more years to achieve my maximum potential, I don't think it really matters. I can try my best to optimize my food intake and my exercise technique, but less than average over a long period of time is more than enough.</p>
