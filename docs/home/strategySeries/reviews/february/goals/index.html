<p>In February, I settled down and cut the volume of work I was responsible for drastically. </p>
<p>It turns out that when you have a large void of time, and don't have any clear direction for what to use it for, it bleeds out and just disappears. A lot of time was spent socializing, having fun, and I've recently started to cook and clean more. It's great and all, but I think I need to be more proactively productive in order to increase the quality of life in my future.</p>
<p>A distinct vision on what I should be doing is what I'm missing. However, it's hard to formulate one in the face of almost limitless possibility. If limitations breed creativity, a lack of them bludgeons creativity to death. I can pretty much do anything but I can't figure out which one should be prioritised to do first.</p>
<p>It's been a good month, and it's been pleasant to experience, but I should probably start creating sparks to see if this time can catch fire and actually yield some forward progress.</p>
<p><strong>Next:</strong> I don't know.</p>
<h1 id="connect">Connect</h1>
<p>With my new-found free time, I've been talking to people more, and attending college more frequently and for longer.</p>
<p>This is a great improvement. As always, though, I can think of ways to do it better.</p>
<p>I think that although I've had a lot of exposure to other people, I could go deeper in the conversations I have and the connections I foster. I'd like to become a better friend and start to really get to know the people I'm around, instead of staying on the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Be more mindful of the conversations you have, and see if you can gently steer them onto more meaningful topics.</p>
<h1 id="prioritize">Prioritize</h1>
<p>I took some time off, and I've realized throughout February that college alone isn't enough to get me towards where I'd like to be.</p>
<p>As per last month's review, I'm more cautious about comitting to projects. I don't have any big projects underway.</p>
<p>I should probably prioritize more reading.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: I don't know.</p>
