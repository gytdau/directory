A lot of time was spent socializing, having fun, and I&#39;ve recently started to cook and clean more. It&#39;s great and all, but I think I need to be more proactively productive in order to increase the quality of life in my future.</p>\n<p>A distinct vision on what I should be doing is what I&#39;m missing. However, it&#39;s hard to formulate one in the face of almost limitless possibility. If limitations breed creativity, a lack of them bludgeons creativity to death. I can pretty much do anything but I can&#39;t figure out which one should be prioritised to do first.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s been a good month, and it&#39;s been pleasant to experience, but I should probably start creating sparks to see if this time can catch fire and actually yield some forward progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Next:</strong> I don&#39;t know.</p>\n<h1 id=\"connect\">Connect</h1>\n<p>With my new-found free time, I&#39;ve been talking to people more, and attending college more frequently and for longer.</p>\n<p>This is a great improvement. As always, though, I can think of ways to do it better.</p>\n<p>I think that although I&#39;ve had a lot of exposure to other people, I could go deeper in the conversations I have and the connections I foster. I&#39;d like to become a better friend and start to really get to know the people I&#39;m around, instead of staying on the surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Next</strong>: Be more mindful of the conversations you have, and see if you can gently steer them onto more meaningful topics.</p>\n<h1 id=\"prioritize\">Prioritize</h1>\n<p>I took some time off, and I&#39;ve realized throughout February that college alone isn&#39;t enough to get me towards where I&#39;d like to be.</p>\n<p>As per last month&#39;s review, I&#39;m more cautious about comitting to projects.
