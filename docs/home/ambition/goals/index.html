<p>I have a lot of freedom right now, which will be severely restricted in a few years. This year is the perfect time to spread myself wider and learn more about the world.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-metrics">Evaluation metrics</h2>
<p>The more new things you try, the better. Give far more value to the things you tried and failed, which indicates that you&#39;ve discovered a boundary, at least for now.</p>
<h2 id="actionable-progress">Actionable progress</h2>
<p>Say no to less invitiations, unless you&#39;ve tried it before. Say no to more invitations where you could instead be doing something new. Allocate time for nothing and use it to wander.</p>
<h1 id="2-connect">2. Connect</h1>
<p>Computer programming is a skill which nets highest gains when done in bursts of isolation. I have to counteract that by making a greater effort to foster deeper connection with others, and encourage growth in myself socially.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-metrics">Evaluation metrics</h2>
<p>The more emotional sense of connection, the better. Give little value to superficial connections like acquaintances. Give more value to people you know well.</p>
<h2 id="actionable-progress">Actionable progress</h2>
<p>Make groups smaller. Go to college more, not for the lectures but for friends. Talk to those you don&#39;t know well. Be there for people.</p>
<h1 id="3-prioritize">3. Prioritize</h1>
<p>The work you do when you&#39;re young compounds when you&#39;re older. Do less work that doesn&#39;t matter, and prioritize learning opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-metrics">Evaluation metrics</h2>
<p>Do more work that you&#39;re both interested in and seems important. Take up learning opportunities. Spend money.</p>
<h2 id="actionable-progress">Actionable progress</h2>
<p>Invest heavily in yourself with both money and confidence. Get excited about the big picture and ignore the small stuff a little more.</p>
