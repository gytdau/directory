<p>I’m sensitive to caffeine, even in tea, which used to be my favourite way to end an evening. The difference cutting out tea makes is big. I’ll get some decaf tea to be able to start that habit again.</p>
<p>On all days for the past few months, ten minutes to three hours have been eaten up by lying in bed or going straight back to sleep. I think this is a hormone thing, where teenagers aren’t supposed to wake up at 8am. </p>
<p>Another factor could be that it’s an issue with the winter season, caused by the lack of light and exposure to the outdoors. I need to start using the LED light more consistently. </p>
<p>The time I go to sleep tends to drift in ten minute increments until I force it to move backwards again. This points further towards the hormone theory, where my body is trying to adjust.</p>
<p>The best schedule which works right now is going to sleep somewhere between 2am and 4am.</p>
<p>This could work:</p>

<p>This is likely to be controversial, but I take a low dose of sleeping pills (like a third of a normal dose) or a very low dose of cannabis whenever I can’t sleep. I am a bad sleeper in general, and a particularly bad sleeper when I travel. It likely has tradeoffs, but so does not sleeping well. — <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity">Productivity, Sam Altman</a></p>
