<p>I&#39;m sensitive to caffeine, even in tea, which used to be my favourite way to end an evening.  The difference cutting out tea makes is big. I&#39;ll get some decaf tea to be able to start that habit again.</p>
<p>On all days for the past few months, ten minutes to three hours have been eaten up by lying in bed or going straight back to sleep. I think this is a hormone thing, where teenagers aren&#39;t supposed to wake up at 8am. </p>
<p>Another factor could be that it&#39;s an issue with the winter season, caused by the lack of light and exposure to the outdoors. I need to start using the LED light more consistently. </p>
<p>The time I go to sleep tends to drift in ten minute increments until I force it to move backwards again. This points further towards the hormone theory, where my body is trying to adjust.</p>

<p>This is likely to be controversial, but I take a low dose of sleeping pills (like a third of a normal dose) or a very low dose of cannabis whenever I can’t sleep.  I am a bad sleeper in general, and a particularly bad sleeper when I travel.  It likely has tradeoffs, but so does not sleeping well. - <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity">Productivity, Sam Altman</a></p>
