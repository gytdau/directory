<blockquote>
<p>Eating lots of sugar is the thing that makes me feel the worst and that I try hardest to avoid.  I also try to avoid foods that aggravate my digestion or spike up inflammation (for example, very spicy foods).  I don’t have much willpower when it comes to sweet things, so I mostly just try to keep junk food out of the house. - <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity">Productivity, Sam Altman</a></p>

<p>Sugary food does not work for me on any scale. Some people suggest cutting down on the sugary food you eat. I don&#39;t think this works well.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really enjoy sugary food, but if I have it around, I&#39;ll instintinctively grab more on autopilot. I almost always feel worse after I eat any volume of it. I think I should figure out how to get rid of it entirely, and replace it with snacks that are less intensely sugary.</p>
<p>Sugary food is extremely widely available. If I were to cut it down by a meaningfully large percentage, the most likely solution would be to tackle my habits in getting food - shop at different places, or preprepare food, or pick snacks that aren&#39;t as sugary.</p>

<p>By cutting down on the amount of meals I&#39;m forced to make, I can enjoy the meals I choose to make.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started eating more fruit, and significantly cut down on the meat I eat on average.</p>
