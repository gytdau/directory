<p>I'm planning on letting my curiosity dictate what I'll write about, and hope that later on I stumble on some concepts I find useful. I don't have enough experience in any one field to refine the scope of this blog, and I also don't want to kill my natural interest by trying to judge if a non-existant reader would theoretically enjoy my post. So this series of posts will be a little rambling.</p>
<p>I'm betting on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I won't want to write in this blog if I needed to optimize for metrics and I wasn't hitting them, making me feel demotivated</li>
<li>It is improbable I will hit any metrics, nor would I really want to at this stage of my life</li>
<li>Writing in this blog will make my writing and thoughts of higher quality</li>
<li>This will pay off later in life</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog will probably <em>not</em> be representative of what I actually do, so you should Google me if that is the information you're looking for.</p>
