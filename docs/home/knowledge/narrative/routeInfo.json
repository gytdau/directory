Our brain is hardwired to store our memories in compressed, cohesive narratives. We can take pretty much any series of events, and string them together in any narrative, and through that we find meaning and purpose.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m starting to find a lot of success in taking control of the storytelling of my own life, and stringing my own events together in a purposely-crafted story of challenge, overcoming, and growth. These stories are fulfilling and encouraging, like a self-fulfilling prophecy where the stories of success you tell allow you to be optimistic enough to achieve even greater succeses.</p>\n<p>Dreams are the stories we tell ourselves of who we might become, and so it&#39;s important that you also tell those stories well and with purpose, instead of leaving the story telling to a background process in your brain, the result of which you might not like.</p>\n","folder":0},"children_notes":[]}}
