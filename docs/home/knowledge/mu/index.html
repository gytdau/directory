<p>It means “no thing”. For example, imagine a computer to have either ones or zeroes. You turn the computer off and ask does it contain a one or zero. The answer to the question is Mu.</p>
<p>Mu is an answer which suggests that the question does not make sense to ask when considering reality. We are conditioned to think that every question has an answer, while offering Mu as a response signifies defeat. This is incorrect. It’s vital to understand that not every question should be asked, and inherent in the question may be significant flaws.</p>
<p>The closest parallel to Mu in English is <em>n/a</em>.</p>
<p>Mu is used to indicate a question whose “answer” is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>un-ask the question,</li>
<li>indicate the question is fundamentally flawed, or</li>
<li>reject the premise that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-dual">dualistic</a> answer can or will be given.</li>
