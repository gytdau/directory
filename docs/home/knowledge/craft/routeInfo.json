Your time would be better spent in this scenario if you were to think of ways to make cleaning happen automatically as you go throughout your day: make cleaning dishes your hobby, habitually do it after eating, or always clean something whenever you pass by. This would instead ensure you spend your effort and willpower once, and then your dishes will clean themselves almost automatically for the rest of your life.</p>\n<p>Code is a craft in a similar way. Instead of making a note that you should refactor or write cleaner code, you should make it a regular part of the process to fix things you find. That means that almost automatically, your projects will have cleaner code.</p>\n","folder":0},"children_notes":[]}}
