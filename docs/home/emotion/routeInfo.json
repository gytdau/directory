This sucks and always seems to happen at inconvenient times.  I have not figured out what to do about it besides wait for the fog to lift, and to trust that eventually it always does.  And I generally try to avoid people and situations that put me in bad moods, which is good advice whether you care about productivity or not. - <a href=\"http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity\">Productivity, Sam Altman</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can&#39;t get the motivation and enthusiasm to do productive work on some days.
