People who broke stereotypes yielded less accurate assesment by the subjects.</p>\n<p>Many gay people do not conform to the gay stereotype.</p>\n<h2 id=\"speech\">Speech</h2>\n<p>Voices that are higher and more melodious are more often labelled gay. This voice, which is more stereotypically feminine, is most likely imprinted from females that the person was influenced by, like parents and friends.</p>\n<p>People can code-switch, which is subconciously slipping into another accent when they are with a different group of people.</p>\n","folder":0},{"path":"home/emotion/beingGay/evolution","name":"Evolution","parent":"home/emotion/beingGay","contents":"<p>Hypotheses for the impact of the post-natal social environment on sexual orientation are weak, especially for males. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation#cite_note-Bailey-4\">(1)</a> This means that sexual orientation is mostly determined by genetics.</p>\n<p>The most convincing reason for a gay gene to be favoured by evolution is called the gay uncle hypothesis.

All those little punches combine with our adaptations to them, she says, and become “automatic ways of thinking that never get challenged or turned off, even 30 years later.” Whether we recognize it or not, our bodies bring the closet with us into adulthood. <a href=\"https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/gay-loneliness/\">Together Alone - Highline</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n","folder":0}]},"siteData":{"title":"React Static"}};</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/bootstrap.1d999e67.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/src/containers/Note.0d36c2f5.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/main.9c4a8b43.js"></script></body></html>
