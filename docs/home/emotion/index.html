<p>Like most people, I sometimes go through periods of a week or two where I just have no motivation to do anything (I suspect it may have something to do with nutrition).  This sucks and always seems to happen at inconvenient times.  I have not figured out what to do about it besides wait for the fog to lift, and to trust that eventually it always does.

<h2 id="winter">Winter</h2>
<p>Ireland has the misfortune of being one of the countries with the least amount of sunlight hours.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the lack of sunlight can be really demotivating. So far, what I&#39;ve found that works is keeping a journal with a list of sequential bullet-pointed tasks for your day, so that there is never any doubt about what&#39;s next. The smaller the tasks are the better.</p>
