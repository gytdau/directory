If you do anything well enough, you&#39;ll make it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first.

This makes todo lists hard to follow, since you&#39;ll see a list of complicated tasks rather than interesting problems to solve. One way you could combat that is by reading a task and thinking about the vision behind it - consider the intricacies, purpose, and meaning.</p>\n","folder":0},"children_notes":[]}}
