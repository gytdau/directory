<p>You should work on, first and foremost, difficult challenges.</p>
<p>Don't care too much about prestige:</p>

<p>Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first.

<p>In my experience, work is easiest and most productive when you're interested in a problem. This makes todo lists hard to follow, since you'll see a list of complicated tasks rather than interesting problems to solve. One way you could combat that is by reading a task and thinking about the vision behind it - consider the intricacies, purpose, and meaning.</p>
