# Networking Fundamentals

Networking is the process of forging, maintaining, and growing healthy relationships. This process has no shortcuts or tricks.

Every relationship, no matter where you're hoping to take it, should start from a friendship. This is the most basic foundation of every connection.

?> This depends on your meaning of friendship. It's unrealistic to be good friends with everyone, although if you can, do so. I think he's talking about a milder, on-good-terms friendship.

You should know what you're aiming for before you start. This can be anything from cultivating social friends, creating business connections, or any mix in between or beyond.

?> Although susceptible to change, I don't have any concrete goals, instead opting to meet anyone I can.

First impressions count. They are your chance to succintly communicate who you are, and although it isn't the end if you start off badly, it does make your work far harder.

## Value

Relationships are about the exchange of value. To start off on the right foot, you should give before you recieve.

Forms of value include:

- Socially, value is exchanged in talking and listening - you provide value when you listen thoughtfully and respond equally so.
- Sharing resources, work, and advice.
- Introductions to other people.
- Making other people's days or lives more pleasant.

To be able to give, you must first understand their story and needs. Don't be too pushy in offering help: start a conversation first.

The value you provide can be multiplied if you change to a more accessible medium, like publishing your work on the internet. This, in essence, starts a relationship between a large swath of people, and you can capture some of the value you end up providing.
