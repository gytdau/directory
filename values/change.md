# Change

We often observe our behaviour, make up a rule that makes it better, and then rely on our willpower alone to bridge the gap between the current you and the better you.

This strategy sucks because willpower sucks. I might be biased because I don't feel like I have any real willpower myself but I imagine it's like hitting yourself with rocks and pretending you're enjoying it to prove a point. Nobody cares about your point. You don't have to pretend that it doesn't suck.

Change also never synthesises from the air, or even from pinkie promises, as powerful as they might be.

My biggest successes come from setting measurable targets and developing strategies to incrementally approach the targets. This works for the trivial stuff, like saving money, or waking up on time, but doesn't work so well for bigger more important things, like being kinder or more fulfilled.

Goals like being kinder are noble, sure, but there's almost no way to measure them, and as such you can't ever tell if you're getting anywhere. Even if you omit any forms of measurements and go on your 'gut', it's really far fetched that your gut can accurately tell you anything meaningful about your life at all.

I don't have an answer on how to fix this. I think it's baked into everyone's experience of reality. I'm hoping that by going in a vaguely positive direction you discover more information that can allow you to judge yourself better, like discovering waypoints on a map that help pin down your own position.
