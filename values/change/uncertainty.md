# Uncertainty

Due to the nature of the knowledge we have, an extreme majority of the information about the choices we want to make is unknown to us. This is just the world we live in today - little is known, and much changes constantly. We have to deal with constant course corrections and dead ends.

Emotionally, uncertainty creates an uneasy feeling. This is hard to deal with, and I'm not sure how to make myself better at dealing with it yet.
