# Failiure

Failiure is a success condition in which you learn something surprising - that the solution you tried didn't work the way you hoped. Failiure presents a wealth of knowledge and only through failiure can we explore and map out what we don't yet know.

Failiure sucks to deal with emotionally - it's kind of like a crushing feeling that can impact you for a couple of days. I'm not sure how to make myself better at dealing with it yet.
