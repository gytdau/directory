# Change

I build my life off of slow, incremental progress. Great things happen through effort applied over time.

My biggest successes come from setting measurable targets and developing strategies to incrementally approach the targets. 

I think that being young and flexible will help making sure that this type of change **occurs quickly** and has a great impact on my life.

## Weight

Weight, when I talk about it here, means all the space that is occupied by objects and thoughts - whether the space is physical or it simply takes up headspace.

You shouldn't be too picky about what you take on, but you should be more guarded with what you keep. This applies to things like buying stuff, where it's easier to throw something away than maintain it long-term, but also to skills, hobbies, and ideas.

To give yourself more options and more flexibility, keep your weight low.

### Being picky

It doesn't make sense to waste your carrying capacity by not doing anything at all, waiting until something perfect comes along. Try to do as much as you can, but by being picky, discard things that are less value when something higher value comes along.
