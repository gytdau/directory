# Integrity

Nobody tells you how hard it is to juggle integrity and vulnerability.

I judge integrity by it's secondary and more technical meaning of internal consistency, like in data. Making sure that my values and my decisions align is one of the most high-value things I do. It benefits me first and foremost rather than anyone else, since following my values will make me more happier and fulfilled, by far.

More practically, you'll know when you're straying from your values, and in some great balancing act the universe will make you feel terrible. It's a way better idea to avoid this in the first place.

I can't be fully transparent to everyone, but I highly value personal integrity in whatever I do end up writing, saying, or doing.
